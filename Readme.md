Simple creator from json text/response with json in body from URL to pojo (java class). 
Additionaly can create new pojo from fields(works look like JsonFilter) from existing json.
Used libs for generating pojo and Jackson JSON PropertyFilter, which selects properties of an object/list/map using a subset of the Facebook Graph API filtering syntax.
